# README #

As it's right now this project contains:  
A class diagram of the extractors (readable from [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)).  
A set of scripts, one for each class, palced at the /src folder.  
  
As the proyect it's brand new, the scripts are prepared to run **only** on the test pages provided, although it's intended to improve the functionality and range of the scripts in the future.  
  
The pages and tables we're actually using as guide are the ones listed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yNP9g8WUKFXFEjaJTGbIcg-HSwPsolSsEcc0ps4WN8Y/edit#gid=0).
